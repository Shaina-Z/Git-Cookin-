\# Learning Aspects

\#\# Learning Domains

Introductory Command Line Use

\#\# Target Audiences

Beginner Programmers at the High School to Early College Level

\#\# Target Contexts

- For supplementary use in a course that teaches Systems Programming at an introductory level  
- This is meant to be used outside of the classroom on the student’s own time

\#\# Learning Objectives

\*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.\*

\- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to traverse file systems.  
\- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to explain how to run and access files.  
\- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to replicate version control.

\#\# Prerequisite Knowledge  
   
\*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?\*

\- Prior to this game, players need to have basic programming knowledge  
\- Prior to this game, players need to explain the concept of Git and/or other Git-like environments

\#\# Assessment Measures

A short pre-test and matching post-test will be given to the player to assess their learning. 

\- Given an empty repository, update your local repository with the remote repository  
\- Given a local repository, update the remote repository with changes made to the files in the local repository  
\- Given a branch, switch between branches  
\- Given a branch, merge changes between branches and fix any potential issues

\# What sets this project apart?

\- Having a safe environment for version control allows for more mistakes to be made and learned from without worrying about repercussions.   
\- The art style creates a welcoming space for beginner programmers and converts usually non-user-friendly concepts to be more user-friendly.
